# E-Commerce Sales Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression #

ðŸ“Œ### Project Overview : ###
This project develops a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict daily sales revenue for an e-commerce store based on key business metrics like:

Website Traffic (Daily visitors)
Advertising Spend (Marketing budget)
Product Discounts (Average discount percentage)
Customer Ratings (Average user feedback score)

The model helps businesses make data-driven decisions by forecasting revenue based on these factors.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used :

Python (Data Processing & Model Development)
Pandas (Data Manipulation)
NumPy (Numerical Computations)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Model)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation Metrics

After training, the model is evaluated using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
The model achieves an RÂ² score of ~0.976, indicating a strong prediction capability.

ðŸ“Š Visualization

The project includes the following plots:
Actual vs Predicted Sales Revenue (Scatter Plot)
Residual Error Distribution (Histogram)
